Please don't change """"At bat"""" to """"at-bat"""". """"At-bat"""" just redirects right back to at bat anyway. -  

I agree.  

I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  

In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  

And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  

It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnación and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  
Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.
@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.
It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  (t / c) 

Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).

Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.

Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  

Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  

 Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .

 As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.

 In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  

Jargon overrides grammar. To say that a batter """"flied out"""" is probably not good grammar either, but it's proper baseball terminology. I think this needs to be discussed at the project page, assuming anyone's watching that page anymore. [[User:Baseball",1.0

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also """"Siryon"""" or """"Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)"""", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites.

Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.

Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.

Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions).

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",1.0

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,1.0

Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

Justin Vaisse's opinion
This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.
 Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. However it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  """,1.0

 Philosopher RFC 
philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a """"philosopher"""" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"philosopher"""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.)

 Definitions 
Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"philosopher"""" or has views on """"philosophy"""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word """"philosopher"""" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article.

 """"philosophical conversation"""", """"philosophy show"""" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series
 """"libertarian"""", """"libertarian thinker"""" - """"Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...""""
 """"anarcho-capitalist"""" - """"Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...""""
 """"voluntaryist"""" - """"Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...""""
 """"athiest"""" - """"Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.""""
 """"ethics- """"Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy""""
 """"Secular ethics- """"Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...""""

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of """"fringe"""" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the """"old-school"""" philosophers we're used to.

 Freedomain Radio """"About"""" page - """"my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies """", """"I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens. I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio. I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy.""""
 Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline """"The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World""""* 
 Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods? A Concise Guide to Atheism and Agnosticism which are two of his more """"deep dives"""" into the fundamental philosophies.

 Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? 

Yesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly """"protect"""" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited """"edit warring,"""" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   
RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were """"reliable,"""" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. 

To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   

I strongly object to your calling me """"disinegnuous"""" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit """"sparked so much conflict and opposition"""" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is """"fair"""" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   

I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    

Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.

"Dunfermline article and new pictures for the Kirkcaldy collage 

hello again. i've been looking at the paragraph about the Kingsgate Shopping Centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the 1980s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the 1980s (specifically between 1983 and 1985), if you want make reference to it, use A Century of Dunfermline or Dunfermline: The Post-War Years. but then, i never thought it was that important how old the centre was, anyway. about the two levels on the car park, it is actually three if you've read the sources.

also, i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park (info is there on the reference Kingsgate extension on schedule for August 2008 opening by Mivan). as we both probably want to get this article to GA, i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for GA status. that's why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the Kingsgate and other retail areas, i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isn't dealt with now, it will be at a later date. 

that aside, i have a new picture of the Beveridge Park which i submitted to Mutt Lucker's home page. (it is now on his talk page if you want to see it) Mutt Lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the Beveridge Park Pond. as well as this, i have another new picture of the Old Kirk Tower (which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website; the clock has been restored since that pic.) and would like to upload it.",1.0

 UFC AFDs 
Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   
I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.    

 Jake Bostwick 
I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    

Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. 

Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. 

Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.

""":Moncrief, do you even know what a shepherd is? I used to work on a cattle ranch, so I know a bit about this stuff. To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the """"Ukrainian"""" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on """"trading the truth""""

The following RfC was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. I trust that you will do the same, Phil.  

Talk:Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as """"removal of spam"""". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is """"spam"""". I'd like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration, and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr. Gronowski. I will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. Thank you very much for your consideration.  """,1.0

On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation.

BI, you said you wanted to talk

At the bottom of the lead section you have written:

""""Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator, but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials"""".""""

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials""""

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is

""""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures.""""

It then goes on to say

""""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""""

So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with """"presently available commercial materials.""""

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

""""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.""""

Regarding: """"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts."""" and 

""""A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts."""".""""

It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies.

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

Unfortunately that is not helpful. I appreciate your attempts but my point that is falling on deaf ears here is this is not a matter of personal opinion. My frustration is only with individuals who believe this is a view point. I have clearly laid out why this is not a POV piece, and still not a single user has proven otherwise, assuming it is a view point simply because it is too long? Is that really a legitimate argument or is Rjensen simply offended that I have challenged the careless lack of regard for scientific knowledge.

I am sorry you think I am in the minority.

There is not even a shred of doubt based on scientific facts that what is transpiring is propaganda, this is not even open for debate. But these people are seriously compromising the integrity of this website by acting like gods, claiming they know more about propaganda than I, based on health information and an industry that they don't fully understand.

 Re:Dennis Brown's final warning 

I didn't mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. I didn't violate the final warning; CurtisNaito did (multiple times). The exact wording of the warning was """"If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility, bludgeons a discussion, violates WP:IDHT, acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors, then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours."""" At no point did I push the boundaries of civility, bludgeon a discussion, violate IDHT, act in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors.

Your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual, when nothing I had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning, was an off-topic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).

The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page.

Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages.

As the Zogby poll shows, 42% of America believes the government is covering up 9/11 and 45% want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved.

For now on, any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol.

See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is?

My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006.

As far as I know it has been stated that several """"universes"""" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those """"universes"""" or """"worlds"""" were not present.

 Colorado balloon incident 

Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. 

Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  

The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.

 Codes and """"minor"""" state 

Please stop Since there is no definition of a """"minor"""" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  
It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
 Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  )
 Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )
What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC)
 Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality. (  )

  Thanks. From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium """"race"""" (whatever """"race"""" might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium """"ethnicity"""". A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

I am old enough to have been around in 1956 (though I was a small boy) and I can tell you that we and our neighbors in Southern California had lighted, outdoor trees prior to 1956, and no one thought it remarkable or unusual.

Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also """"the"""" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German """"von"""" or """"zu"""" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture.

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

It's only a problem when it's exploitative. Like white girls wearing bindis and then selling said bindis and then marketing them as Dharma Dots or Dots not Feathers. An insulting marketing of another culture that disrespects said culture to make money. Though this kind of naked exploitation is rarely tolerated on any serious scale so not really a usual concern. I agree that cultural ideas exchanged and flowing between people is not an issue. But exploitation does happen. I think the key problem is that we all spend too much time on the Internet which is notorious for magnifying insignificant outliers nitpicking minor complaints reflective of new problems in society.

Hi everyone,
I was wondering about what articles are needed for the Doctor Who Monsters + Enemies. I was thinking of enemies from the new range of books from the series i.e. The Clockwise Man, The Monsters Inside. There were some rather interesting enemies including Melissa Heart and the Mechanicals (which I could write a rather long article on) and maybe even the globs from The Monsters Inside. Or how about a sub category for the Blathereen on the Slitheen page? Please leave a list of suggestions so I can get to work.

 Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten 

i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.

The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film """"David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"""").

There are many others, and I'm sure you know them. Sadly for you it's only now that you've realised what they really mean! REAL Pathans have known all along (as you can tell from the Pashto proverbs) that language and culture can be lost and acquired, but being able to trace yourself to the Geneolgical tree of the Pathans is what eventually counts regardless of everything - hence the reason why there are so many proverbs on this subject.

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:

Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a """"name"""" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.

Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as """"2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"""" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.

Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching """"please categorise these pages"""" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.

Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.

As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk """,1.0

The books of Maccabees and the Gospels refer to the land (and nation) as """"Israel"""" throughout this period and the term is still used in Acts.

Similarly as explained in the article it was only after Herod the Great that the Roman expanded the usage of their term """"Judaea"""" to include more or less the entire region that Herod had ruled. Maccabees and the NT are the primary sources referring to the land and nation as Israel, for a modern academic publication secondary source, see for example """"King Herod: a persecuted persecutor  a case study in psychohistory and psychobiography"""", by Aryeh Kasher & Eliezer Witztum, Walter de Gruyter, 2007 where Herod is clearly referred to as King of Israel and e.g. """"A survey of Israel's history"""" by Leon James Wood & David O'Brien, Zondervan, 1986, which refers to the Hasmonean ruling over """"Israel"""" or say """"The Holocaust: roots, history, and aftermath"""", David Crowe, Westview Press, 2008 which similarly speaks of Hasmonean """"Israel"""".

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

I hope that you might also realise that if in your words the case here is """"thankfully relatively rare"""", why many people would then think that applying a blanket measure such as Flagged Revisions is not very appropriate at all. I contrast it as the British Government contending every citizen must be forced to carry an identity card, on the presumption that is the best way you can catch terrorists, which happen to also be """"thankfully relatively rare"""". Why not for example in this specific case take a more intelligent approach, and implement sopmething that prevents or flags any edit that adds the word """"molesting"""", instead of forcing onto all BLP articles an incredibly blunt and incredibly bad faith assuming measure? (and any interested observers, please, stop before you say it, these valid concerns with what FR is/could be cannot all just be washed away by referring to the quite irrelevant 'advantage' of FR of opening up the tiny minority of protected articles).

And to further address the specific example you give, maybe you can expand on why anybody would be likely to believe that one sentence claim, when it was added to the article along with another 15 sentences, which at best hint at the whole thing being a hoax, and at worst, screams delete me now for being total WP:BOLLOCKS. We can also discuss how an editor in between the vandalism and your removal 'fixes the article for typos'  without noticing that it is 90% complete bollocks? Even when one of the typos is a few words away from the molesting red flag. A systemic failure perhaps?

And finally, as an admin, perhaps you can tell me why the IP user is not now blocked, irrespective of how long ago the edit occurred. Incidentally, the now famous bad account on Ted Kennedy was also not blocked immmediately after his first edit was a BLP violation on an unrelated article. Another systemic failure?

I'm all for criticla analysis of cases 'FR would have prevented', because they frequently pose more questions than they answer, about the whole model of Wikipedia, never mind how we efficiently and intelligently prevent BLP violations.   """,1.0

 A problem with """"English Patriot Man"""" and his sockpuppets 

Hi. Lately I've seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named: """"English Patriot Man"""". I see that this man is nearly obsessed with Polish people. He seems to spread his anti-Polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning World War II, nazism in Europe and racism against Poles. He is totally denying the sufferings of the Polish nation. 
Thank you so much for taking care of him, and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. However, now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place, so that his personal data and IP address would be totally different. This is why I suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like:
 Racism in Poland 
 Racial policy of Nazi Germany
 War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II
 Nazi crimes against the Polish nation
 Invasion of Poland
 Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II
 Nazism and race

 Master race
 White supremacy
 Racial hygiene
 Nuremberg Laws
 Aryan race
 Aryanization

 White nationalism

 Racial_segregation

 Persecution of black people in Nazi Germany
 Occupation of Poland (1939–45)
 Polish decrees
 Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany
 Forced labour under German rule during World War II
 Extermination through labor
 Anti-Polish sentiment
 Anti-Slavic sentiment
 Polish question

 Rassenschande

 Scientific racism

 Germanisation

 Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world
 Glossary of Nazi Germany
This guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about Poles being percieved as """"subhumans"""" or """"non-Aryans"""" by the nazis. In fact the only """"Aryan-looking"""" Poles that were accepted by Nazi Germany at the time, were kidnapped as children and underwent """"Germanisation"""", they were like 0.05% of the whole nation. The rest of the Poles were """"insufficient"""" to be a part of the nazi-ruled nation, and were treated only slightly better that the Jews. 
This guy, he spreads lies all across Wikipedia, therefore I thank you for your quick and effective actions Diannaa. If you'd need any kind of help in restoring the data which """"English Patriot Man"""" destroyed, just tell me. I will also try to patrol the articles about Poles.   """,1.0

(Recent article/talk page history: , ). You haven't edited the article since 2007  and you must have  thousands of  other articles that need improvement on your watchlist.  

You could have posted an article edit request to the PL noticeboard  re this, as you have for many articles during the past few months.

In my view the A.M. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcoming-ness. The remainder of the appeal, in which you speak of WP's losses from your lack of participation, that's a different story that others can think over. 

If you remove the A.M. section I shan't contest your appeal, since lifting your topic ban now or in March doesn't make much difference in the long run. But I am concerned about that part - possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. You could either remove that section (since it hasn't been commented on there yet) or strike it. If you choose not to do either, I may bring it up at the AE appeal.

I notice that a number of U.K. songs are listed as Past Masters when they actually first appeared on Rarities (1978 The Beatles album). I don't know the reason for this if the purpose is to list the first appearance on an album. Can someone explain? Or should they be changed to Rarities?  """,1.0

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

 Why is the lingo/doublespeak/racist word """"contractors"""" used instead of the precise English word """"mercenaries"""" 

This is an encyclopedia not a press release.

Wikipedia is not supposed to be the house organ of any one government, but this article uses a lingo/doublespeak/racist term that the USA uses to describe mercenaries of any country other than a predominantly Caucasian political ally.

Wikipedia should be filtering out spin words an translating them into proper English.

I suggest that """"contractor"""" only be used for unarmed non-military non-police contractors.

This simple rule should apply:  If the term """"mercenary"""" would be used to describe the job or person if the person were being paid by an agency working for an African government, the term """"mercenary"""" should be used to describe the job or person working for a non-African government.

End the racism.  Speak in plain English.  This is an encyclopedia not a press release.

 Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.""",1.0

I don't think his argument is at all valid, but in the course of looking stuff up on the web I've discovered that some fans of the movie apparently consider the SG-1 series to be somehow illegitimate or non-canon. I'm not familiar with the Stargate fan community, just the show itself, so I don't feel comfortable adding discussion of this directly to the article.

great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called """"post-industrial"""" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as """"noise music"""".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   """,1.0

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

No, I will make sure that will be removed permanently.  I will not do this for awhile to avoid violations, but hope that someone else will consider and agree.  There is no reason whatsoever to put """"the late"""" in front of his name, I will list several reasons, and although I think that is somewhat POV, there are other reason as to why I remove the info:
Everyone dies sometime - Does it really make sense to have an article about a past event and just put """"the late"""" in front of everyone that has died?
Poor writing - It's just sloppy/filler writing to put """"the late"""" in place.  Would you ever see anyone referred to as """"the late"""" in a print encyclopedia?
Recentism - WP has a guideline/template that we should try not to capitalize too much on recent events and keep them in perspective.  Would it make sense 10 years down the road to still refer to him as """"the late""""?  Let's make things as static as possible.
Precedent - At one point, several dozen articles referred to Steve Irwin as """"The late Steve Irwin"""", now, this is the only one that does (by doing a search), and there seems to be consensus about that.
Knowledge of his death - Let's face it, a vast majority of people (especially those that would look for this article) know he is dead, and the few that may not be sure can click the link.  Maybe people don't want to know that he's dead or be reminded of it, and putting that acts as a spoiler.  Even Anna Nicole Smith had a few """"the lates"""" put on pages of hers, and those have all been removed (a few by me, a few by others). """"Saving a click"""" is not a valid reason for this, we should assume that the readers are smart, and things like that can go to the Simple English edition.
Irrelevance - Why would the fact that he is dead be relevant to an article that talks about his programming?  His shows will probably be reran for many years to come, and the fact that he died somewhat unexpectedly makes no bearing on what he did on his programming.

Well, this is my case, I would also like to point out WP:OWN, which I feel has been violated in these reverts.

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above.

She would always take 1 unpaid intern per social worker to give them an extra set of hands and to let then gain experience. She would often hire these students when they graduated if they had an opening. 

They worked on mostly government contracts. 

The province decided to make unpaid internships illegal. 

She couldn't afford to pay for the extra help, and now both the students who used to be unpaid interns don't have those spots to get experience and her clients/patients don't get the same quality of care.

Many perhaps most of the 5,000 editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits, I can think of two FA writers in that group, one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits, another spends a lot of time on AWB. Any analysis of those 5,000 would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types. Then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits, and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed. But most importantly, the 5,000 accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active 3,156. ''SpielChequers'' 12:48""",1.0

But in fact there is not one document - notably her Testament - that I can find that refers to them as such. Merely as his daughters with the honorific 'Lady' because they were daughters of an Earl.

Response to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann

I reverted your edit because you give partial information, not because of the  wording I prefer. What parts do not make sense? The ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? Stop saying it is bad English, if it was just that you'd fix it without removing information.

""""Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation"""" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:

1-  It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear.
 
2- Several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police. 
Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:

3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as """"forging evidence"""": """"He [Gonçalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being."""" 

4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine).
In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).  
It seems that the British  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:

5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking  

6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing: 

5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. """"The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her"""" Something made them change their minds?

The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has. 
I hope it was clearly written and the """"parts of it do not make sense"""" start to make sense.
I am going to revert the edit, you are welcome to correct any """"bad English"""", not the information.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

As I suspected, complete nonsense. Your statement is so silly that I can't begin to tell you how wrong it is. You said, """"You there presume that your not-yet-filed Arbcom case has been decided"""".

Here's a few points for you to think on.

WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
Then let's consider the ArbCom an article. What then is this articles content?
Hmm, let's see … the ArbCom is an article, so what is the ArbCom made of? Why, members. So that means the content of the committee is it's members. So an election is a decision on the content of this article.
So.
Members are editors, so content is editors, so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.
We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.
You don't like that?
WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
But ArbCom is not an article. It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.
We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.
We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.
Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential. Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.
Your threats of blocks I regard as an attempt to bully. Do not try to bully me.

""""Some 20,000 Jews currently live in Iran. The authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion, but forbid the import of Israel-made products to the country, an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years."""" 

While they probably didn't get an exact census of the people they were delivering to, I'd guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. So 20,000 seems to be the way to go.

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists.

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",1.0

"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

In addition, for like the fourth time, this person decides to call me """"a full blown believer and pusher of this conspiracy theory"""" which I repeatedly denied.  I took offense.

To have User:scray come along and say stuff like """" Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, name-calling (a personal attack) won't go well.""""  I did not call a name. I called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that I was calling it as it presented itself.

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.

In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

Also the nature of basic income is at a theoretical philosophy stage, and the highest quality references possible are available to verify and preferably succinct, and high quality blogs provide the best verifiability, IMO, but regardless of this opinion, a section on proposed benefits does not need prestigious academic references if the claim being made is that the ideas and rationale has merely been proposed.  To keep the bicycles/wagons analogy, the page was a high quality bicycle, and an important bicycle to 4 wikigroups.

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

I don't mean skinny arms with spider-veins, but muscles on forearms with the one or two enlarged veins up the length. It gets women rock hard. I've been working in manufacturing for several years and I'm getting to the muscle structure of a 26 year-old going on 35, because I work with heavy materials and tools 6 days of the week. I've noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost.

Well, in case anyone's interested in following up on this further, using the La Trobe University on-line search engine, a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ (truncated to allow for various inflections) leads to 77 (BJT) record hits, at least 65 of which are in the Pali Canon.  Here's the first page of the search results (with links to the subsequent pages as well):  http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pitikaresults.php?title=&start;=60&to;=70&searchstring;=mahāpurisalakkhaṇ .  
Of course, this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term (nor what this term means in the context of various suttas) since multiple records can be part of a single sutta.  (Similarly, this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the Pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term, etc.).  
FWIW, a quick review of these results (potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas) shows 40 hits in the Digha Nikaya, 15 in the Majjhima Nikaya, none in the Samyutta Nikaya, 3 in the Anguttara Nikaya, and 7 in the """"canonical"""" Khuddaka Nikaya (mostly in the Suttanipata), 5 in the paracanonical KN words (e.g., Netti, Peta), one in the Abhidhamma's Kathavatthu, once in the Visuddhimagga, and 5 times in the Pali histories.  If nothing else, this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by Peter and myself might possibly be (among?) the core texts. -)

 Disruptive Activity 

 Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to vandalize Wikipedia, as you did at Paracetamol, you may be blocked from editing.    🍌 (email) 

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   

 I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.

I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.   🍌 (email) 

 This isn't about my feelings, it is about your behavior. You revert me with no reason, then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense, then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing. This is why Wikipedia is dying, cannibalizing its editors and edits in a Kafkaesque farce. Congratulations, I'm sure your no-doubt proper and uplifting ZYZZYXRD will be cited upon its demise.

Please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. 

In this particular case, the discussion was started by user Brad, who made a personal comment about me. Now, I dont mind this, I was more curious than offended, but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which I started on Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)‎. You claimed that my post which you deleted was a 'POV inserted into a neutral notice'. It may have been a POV, about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later, but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work, and thus the implicit POV that it was undesireable. It was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting.  If you are going to start censoring postings, then I would suggest you do so impartially.  You did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice, but merely removed one comment.

Maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words (i.e., change “social perceiver” -> “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. 
Instead of a “in the real world” I would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.
Using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well, followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. This would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”. 
Overall, I thought that this was a really interesting article and I think that you did a great job with the explanations and examples. I really like the organization of the article and the content seemed accurate.

So what if the average European drinks that early? You do understand that it really fucks with your brain right? Realistically speaking the drinking age should be 21-25 minimum. When you’re younger your brain is still growing and you’re more susceptible to big changes that would be more problematic in the future. Also if you start drinking earlier you are more likely to start developing an addiction. Also it’s illegal. And you’re argument that “ generally we start drinking at 14” doesn’t solve any of those problems right? It’s just a sad excuse of blaming your continent and people instead of yourself.,3.5

 Randroide Answers to """"Next Step"""" 

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.

I can not do this job because I always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing """"El País"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the """"moral certitudes"""" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.

  I agree with you 100%, Larean.

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your """"Randroide omits..."""" section.

If you have not subscription to """"El País"""", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"El País"""" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.

Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.

BTW, if you write under a """"Randroide answers"""" section you are:
Invading """"my"""" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.
Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE """"Randroide answers"""" sections.

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not """"mine"""".

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.

  

All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article

Very funny, Southofwatford. 

I am going to follow this joke of yours.

Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.
Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.
Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.

It is not the business of the governments to try to outlaw things that don't facilitate marriage.  American adults get to choose what kind of sex life they wish to have with other wiling adults.  No one wants a church-government.

Hi David,

Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at Talk:DepoProvera. (And for reminding me it's Guy Fawkes!)

I feel that I don't need to assure you that I will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re Pfizer/LaCroix/BMD in the current disputebut just in case, please be assured that I will not.  It might actually be helpful to have other people than Mastcell and I making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere, as well, if not enough editors contribute in a week or two week's time.

I will be slow-to-respond/disengaged on the Depo talkpage, in hopes of keeping things cool, while still continuing to advance the discussion. There is no hurry and deadline, after all.:-)

I don't know if you've been following the discussion at Emergency Contraception, but MastCell's first post to Depo occurred less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of this exchange: . It seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking, but it also seems to me that he arrived at Depo already quite upset/confrontational, etc.    Because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e., he is angry re EC page and following me to Depo, (and Dalkon Shield) to express animosity, I think it is better that the Depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.

Seriously? As a matter of canonical law the Church is fine with (and encourages!) non-procreational sex as long as its within marriage? What the heck ever happened to Genesis 38:9-10?

Many thanks for checking and investigating. It is a shame there's nothing more recent. From p23 of Curatolo(2003), """"Diagnosic Criteria"""", I get:
The rate of occurrence of tuberous sclerosis at birth is unknown...(paragraph continues with stats trying to come up with a figure)... This indicates that the real incidence at birth may be as high as 1:6000 (Webb et al. 1993, Cardiac rhabdomyomas and their association with tuberous sclerosis, Arch Dis Child 68:367–70)

Earlier, when talking about Hunt and Lindenbaum's 1984 study, he says """"The scientists believed that the birth prevalence might be even higher than it is now considered to be."""" I don't have that paper so don't have more details.

An editorial by Fryer (Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine 1991, 84:699) says """"... suggesting a birth incidence of 1:10000"""". I don't have the Osborne paper you mention. I've seen 1:5800 mentioned but don't know its source at present.

My sources seem to use incidence and prevalence interchangeably wrt to birth. I'm happy to change it if you think it may be less ambiguous.

The list of prevalence figures throughout the years comes from Curatolo (2003), Table 2.6, page 22. This in turn is based on an earlier table by Shepherd in his short chapter """"The Epidemiology of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex"""" in the book Gomez 1999.

The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution.  From these I have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions.  Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy.  I read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.",1.0

"Yes you got it - the Govt lied.  See the talk page for CSELR (OK, I'm lazy and not typing current page name!).  They provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from.  I have provided the link to the index of papers produced (mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw) so you can confirm that the Business case was never provided.  There are no source documents for any figure contained in the Business Case Summary.  Some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post-TfNSW publications (such as with the Capacity claimed by GB on the MR for the Modification Approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are 50% lower.).

 I am one of 8 community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about.  That is why I have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language.  The minutes for the Community Rep meeting with TfNSW are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions.  The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.  I have since discovered that 4 of the community reps are current employees of the State Govt and 1 is a past (self-proclaimed) senior executive of TfNSW.  So not only do they not tell the truth - they have also stacked the Community Reference Group.

 That is why there was the 2nd call for papers specifically naming the missing documents as that was the only way for the Upper House MPs to publicly state - the Govt has not provided what we asked for as they were supposedly only going to be in the 'confidential (2) boxes that the MPs could not talk about after looking at.

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway?  Keep the chronology clearer.   (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.

I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is """"one step removed"""" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

"Gothic Metal and Death Rock 

Nice call on the removing of metal traces in the Death Rock article. Im having similar problems with the Gothic Metal article on people with little to no knowledge of the subjects editing the article and trying to draw an association between Goth Music and Gothic Metal when there isnt one. Perhaps the Death Rock and Gothic Rock articles could do with a bit of an overhaul. Ive seen that youve edited the Death Rock article quite a bit, so i assume you know a lot about the subject.

I suggest, if your willing to listen, that you read the Gothic Metal article. Firstly so you better understand what it is, and secondly so you can work better with it, and its contents, on drawing the big black line (or pink if you prefer) that divides the two by a long way.

I call out to you as a fellow editor of articles, simply because i do not know enough about Goth Rock or Death Rock to compently edit them, mainly due to my work and association in the metal scene.

xkcd

Hey!  A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me (Randall Munroe), labeling it """"patently made-up information"""".  Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcd
I find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an 
I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.  It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.

Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page, but you're right  you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not.  I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.
In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance.  - Schreit mich an 
 Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was.  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor).  When I said """"I work for NASA"""" no one argued.

 It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect.  Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way.  I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work, and it was good in a lot of ways, but I was happy to leave.  xkcd

 Can you nominate my entry 

Hey BigHaz, can you please show me how the nomination process goes for DYK, I mean is it nominated the same way like featured articles are nominated. Actually, this thing is new to me. Thanks  
Sure thing. The way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the """"hook"""". That gets put onto the Suggestions page, which I'll move it to in a moment. Over the next few days, people will make various comments about it - if the """"hook"""" is too long, if it needs sources, whatever else. If you're able to respond to those comments (if there are any made), then your article might get selected.  - Schreit mich an 
 By suggestion pages you mean to say talk pages or what  
  
It's not easy to do that, since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page, so I really can't just point you to a page and say """"here you are"""". What particularly do you want to see? If you're after examples of the kinds of comments people make, just keep an eye on the Suggestions page.  - Schreit mich an

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,1.0

The Nazis indeed made some huge mistakes: the anti-Slavic agenda was what ruined them.

By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

Firstly, some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts?  Also, the reason I decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what I had said.  Perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what I said but they did not apply to what I said and meant.  Perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what I mean and try not to take offense so easily.  I am respecting the basic rules of Wikipedia, but I also exploited """"loop holes"""" in the rules.

Also, if I go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then I can site that and it becomes verifiable right?

This is the intro which was on the Palpatine page for a very long time:

Once an ambitious Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Galactic Republic at the time of the Clone Wars, and later is the man who becomes the Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

yesterday, user Robeykr changed it to this:

Once an ambitious yet unassuming Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic shortly before the time of the Clone Wars, and later became absolute leader of the most crushing totalitarian government in the history of the galaxy. Ultimately, it was revealed that Palpatine was the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of enormous power and considerable cunning.

I changed it back, and tried to clean it up a little:

Once a Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and later becomes Galactic Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",1.0

I've come across variations on draughts, as I've always called it - we had a compendium of games that came in a cube - it had six sides on it, one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on.

With draughts, apart from the traditional version, there were the following variations:

Dammspiel - that's what the manual called it - I think it's also called Damenspiel - you set them up a bit like chess, but they were placed one square forward (hard to explain) - the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts - diagonally, one square - I think the kings could move multiple squares - a bit like the """"Flying Kings"""" rule people have mentioned - except that you stop short of capturing - my memory is hazy on the issue.

Turkish Checkers - similar set-tup to Dammspiel/Damenspiel - it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces, the set-up being on the same squares you'd use for draughts - pieces move one square forwards, and, if I remember rigtly, capture diagonally, like standard draughts - the kings, I believe, move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line - again, my memory is hazy regarding the rules.

One game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names - Arrow Draughts, Dagger Draughts or Kings.

Played similar to standard draughts - you play it corner-to-corner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger - you then play it like regular draughts.

I have played draughts with at least three opponents - a relative, somebody at school and somebody I once shared a house with - and they were convinced that a single man can't take a king.  Apparently, according to this page, that's the rules in Italian draughts.""",1.0

"Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.",1.0

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

Hi there, you suggested a merger, but you did not start a discussion, I think there may be a case for this but moving acousmatic music to acousmatic would be the wrong way to approach it. Instead, I would suggest changing the title of the acousmatic article to 'acousmatic sound' so that the page can function as a sub-secion of 'acousmatic music'; which is a particular form of electroacoustic music, one which specifically uses acousmatic sound sources. The acousmatic sound article might focus more on Schaefers' and Chions' theories while the acousmatic music page could deal with the artistic practice of using sound in an acousmatic context.

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia  since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such. 

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

"banging your head against a wall 

Hi, I see JayJG has been leaving messages on your page, with his false concern about the rules and supposed reasonableness.  In reality, JayJG is a rabid Zionist and is trying to purge Wikipedia of any negative information about Zionism, and is trying to paint Muslims in a bad light.  Along with many of his cohorts.

The problem is that JayJG is part of the Wikipedia cabal.  When there were elections, despite massive efforts to the contrary, a number of people got a higher vote percentage than JayJG - but Jimbo Wales put him on ArbCom anyhow.  Jimbo has shown his true colors as well.

These people control Wikipedia.  They are all together, and attacking you.  No one is coming to your aid.  This is because they control Wikipedia, with Jimbo at the center, and have more or less driven off everyone else.  You are banging your head against a wall here - any massacre by Zionists against Palestinians will be covered up, disorted, justified etc., anyone who attacks an Israeli soldier will be castigated here.

My suggestion is to direct your efforts to somewhere more creative, like a wiki encyclopedia that is not pro-Zionist and anti-Muslim like this one.  Or if you do continue here for a little bit, to spend less time.  It is better to waste 5 hours of time accomplishing nothing than 10.  Eventually you will give up here, everyone does.

Really it's not. I'm Australian, don't regard myself as a PC-pusher but I'd think Uluru has moved ahead of Ayer's Rock as the preferred name by most people. Certainly when I was younger (in the 1980s) it was pretty much unheard of to say Uluru and anything other than Ayers Rick made you look like some sort of lefty nutter but in the last 10 years or so it's changed. Oh and using Qantas as an example is probably not ideal - the airport they fly to is called Ayers Rock so it's understandable they'd prefer that name. Anyway just my 2c...   05:02, 18 June 2014",1.0

"Deletion of AV News page 

Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.

Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.

Here is the content:

The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.

History

The AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.com

The paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.

Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.

External links
AV News Official Website

The format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.

I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.

I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.

All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.

"My 2c to get beyond the stalemale is to let skeptics raise all controversies surrounding chiropractic, find the best sources to neutrally present the material and roll into into a Criticisms section.  Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.

 Dear Just plain Bill 
 Please explain why you could ignore the fact that User:Michael Bednarek couldn't have answered at all and, moreover, revert as if you were User:Michael Bednarek and User:Spinningspark.
 Please explain why you cannot wait and see for a while(only 72 hours, as mentioned above). 
 Apparently your vandalism reverts have no reasonable reason as well as Bednarek's and Spinningspark's, because you, Spinningspark, and Bednarek have left the 1)lead 2)unsourced, that looks like evil vandalism and cruel personal attack with bald-faced lies. Please explain why you could ignore your obvious contradictions(lies).
 Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be helpful as an encyclopedia(WP:5P).
 Please explain why you can think that disambiguation pages without necessary important lead can be written from a neutral point of view(WP:5P) and why you have tried to force us stop kind and quick-witted human beings with common sense. (It seemed that , , and User:Spinningspark are cruel Nazis, or facists, unfortunately.) 
 The third pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute"""". This means that Wikipedias are not even admins' private websites and that to revert other editors' distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all. Please explain why you can have been doing the contrary.
 The forth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner"""". Please explain why you can have been doing the opposite.
 The fifth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia does not have firm rules"""". Please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary.
 Please explain why you can ignore all of WP:5P?
 Please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. The important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below: """"Harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords, later, becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down"""". 
 Please explain why you can leave the unsourced OR sentence while unfairly accusing me of """"unsourced OR"""". The OR lead you have left is below: """"usually refers to the frequency components of a time-varying signa"""".  
 Please explain why you can express(lie) """"restore"""", though in fact you """"ruin""""ed the lead apparently. 
 Please explain why you didn't edit positively at all when you are not satisfied with others' edits. 
 Please explain why you cannot think your unreasonable deletings are obviously useless and harmful vandalism against other editors and readers.
 Please explain why you cannot be responsible at all for the  tag""""For other uses, see Harmonic (disambiguation)"""" in the article page """"Harmonic"""".

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown.

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",1.0

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute.

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same.

I was under the impression Solus Operating System was a Linux distro and not to be confused with what has a page on here called SolusOS - are you that same project? If not, which I think is the case, I can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article (blanking this one) called Solus Operating System, so long as that is available. If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons. Anyway, I am enjoying your OS. If you get around to it could explain to me what makes Solus its own OS rather than a Linux distro? Also, I understood that although you use Budgie, Gnome is behind it.

 Narciso Yepes 

Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166   

 Your discussion at Narciso Yepes 

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.

The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)

Thanks,",1.0

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

'As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk) '

 Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people 

This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.

The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.

And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.

Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""""  What's the association between the two?

Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.

As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975.

"Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff. MediaWiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under $1500. I’ll take the poor documentation associated with open-source software any day.",1.0

Alongside Clayface, a resurrected one-off concept from 1940 (there are 6 resurrections in total).

In the 1970s, new Batman villains begin to adopt influences from horror and realistic crime fiction (secret agent films), first with Man-Bat (who unlike Batman, is a real human/animal hybrid) and the later with the master criminal Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia, the first villains to learn Batman's identity. (very ok!!!)

The less famous villan, but often equally charismatic Ventriloquist, KGBeast, Black Mask and Killer Croc emerged iduring the 1980s.

More common criminals, such as the Gotham mob leader Carmine Falcone were also added to the villain lineup

The 1990s were notorious for the introduction of the Joker's assistant, Harley Quinn who appeard exclusivley in the cartoon series.

Bane, was the only villain to physically humble Batman. Hush and a new Red Hood are the most famous inductees in the 2000s, due to their connections to Batman's past

A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now """"Greek islands"""" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated """"Greek"""" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.
 
Thus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British.""",1.0

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.""",1.0

"It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.

Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, """"Joe at worms"""" then we write """"Joe ate worms"""".

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

This is really smart. There's an entry saying someone blanked a page. How clever. But I am using this IP and I certainly didn't blank any page.

Wiki's omniscient henchmen suggest registering an account. It's no longer a wiki then is it? Registering an account is not a good idea anyway. Far better is to stop blocking IPs like this. Most people are on non-static IPs anyway so the idea is 'last millennium'.

What you really need is to filter out the junk that gets people pissed off in the first place. If Wikipedia had any quality at all - and not just a bunch of do-nothings who patrol and feel tough about it - and there wouldn't be any vandalism at all. People would be proud and respectful of the place.

"Referring to her as *Catherine* 

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals.  

As for males, I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie, *Leicester* -  or last name - ie, *Dudley*.  I was banging head on keyboard going, but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie, Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England -

False statement

A continuous random variable does not always have a density.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.4.140.135   

Definition
I dont like the definition here, not that I'm letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting, but could this be considered a clearer definition?:

""""Random Variable

The outcome of an experiment need not be a number, for example, the outcome when a coin is tossed can be 'heads' or 'tails'. However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.

There are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous.

A random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable).

I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) 

The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. The above definition is far better on both counts and so I will put it on the page.   

BTW, sorry about the no summary edit, I hit the enter key accidentally.   

Examples

 A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted. X can only take the values 0, 1, ..., 10, so X is a discrete random variable.
 A light bulb is burned until it burns out. The random variable Y is its lifetime in hours. Y can take any positive real value, so Y is a continuous random variable. 
""""

I think the above definition (for the original reference, pls search via google) explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value, rather like a numeric index to a database record. This would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. The earler Wikiedia definition led me to comment on another Wikipedia definition incorrectly because I think I may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this Wikipedia definition.

A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. This example:

just assigns another event to an event. Could we change it to something like:

Consider a game where if a 6 is rolled on a fair six-sided die, player 1 wins, and otherwise, player 2 wins. Let X represent the number of times player 1 wins. Then

and

or maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? What do you think?

Speedy deletion of Phi Rho Eta
 A tag has been placed on Phi Rho Eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Sorry i have not been in touch for a while. I have been in United Kingdom. Singapore is truly amaing. The People are wonderful they live to serve and they are well trained in respect. Singapore is a different world to Australia and a different world to where I'm in. The last weekhas been full on!!!! I have spent many days in London then head towards Grantham then Stratford-Upon-Avon (Shakespeare's Country)and now in the world#s most Educated city and oldest cities in the world, OXFORD. Lord of the Rings was created here (Not the Movie) but the story trilogy was here. England is sort of similar to Australia, only older, more history, more pubs,more people,tiny parking spaces and so many red double decker buses. I'm doing all right for money and spent some at London's Best Gamesworkshop in Oxford Street. Gamesworkshops are bigger and better in England. I have been to a couple but can't buy much because of space in my ags. Rohan & Saun would love these Gamesworkshops in England. There are Mini Gamesworkshops in Villages smaller than Broadford, and still they are fanstatic. Bigger Gamesworkshops are manily in more bigger Towns and Cities eg Nottingham, London, Mancester, Oxford and many more. Tell Rohan that i went past the Gamesworkshop Headquarters, the Citadel Miniatures Factory and Warhammer World in Nottingham. But Unfortunaly i could not go because we had no time because our destination was Derbyshire and ran out of time. But I certainly will go there when i come back to England if i have time.

It's more of just a blob of information being thrown at me with cool facts thrown in. You can separate the tournaments like """"ACCs"""" and """"NCAAs"""" and then list what happened or what awards were accepted. Also, maybe you could start off with where lacrosse started or came from, or just highlight the word lacrosse with a reference. Then perhaps inform the reader a bit about the history of UNC lacrosse. Could also have a section of UNC's present lacrosse team and their status to really keep the reader up to date with UNC lacrosse. Otherwise, keep finding more stories and information about UNC lacrosse and be sure to organize and really make it flow all together.

I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""""IroK"""") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.
Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the """"IroK"""" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term """"recognition"""" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.

Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

"""I'm back. I already created  ID (occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class C when I do) I collected a massive number of diff edits on Balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is  on record] getting blocked for saying this about Greeks under a previous handle. (not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)

""""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. 

I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a """"proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. 

As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves """"ethnic Athenians"""" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). 

There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)

February 26, 1992: The FYROM's President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: '""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.'

""""January 22, 1999: The FYROM's Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: '""""We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM's second largest trading partner and its number one """"investor.""""'

February 24, 1999: The FYROM.'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the """"Ottawa Citizen"""", he admitted: '""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.""""'

I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM's own government's previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)

Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians. (and don't get me started on that incident where Gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of """"United Macedonia"""" was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article)

More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a """"conspiracy theory"""" is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, """"generally and """"commonly considered"""" in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",1.0

My understanding is that it was Constantinople's position that Rome objected to (which, granted was at the core of Justinian's pentarchy) but not the idea of the patriarchate system as a whole. Even so, though, it's not like Rome pulled out of future councils or in any other substantial ways severed itself from the emperor at that time. In other words, it is certainly true that there were many violent disagreements, some of which led to temporary schisms, but to my understanding Justinian's system, even if not everybody liked it, became a practical reality (one that indeed helped fuel the fire that pushed Rome further and further away).",1.0

I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew.

I think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe, especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote
Attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work
which it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.
I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was """"to achieve the productivity that was possible"""" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.
Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?
Some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of """"for want of a nail""""-type angle  """"Look, Prime Minister, you've gathered all these first-class minds here but we can't get anything done because we have to do our own bloody TYPING!""""  if sources lay something like that out.

"Tangential Forces 
 
The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.

During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.

We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.

In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.

In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.

Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.

More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.

They they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about.",1.0

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""""clarification"""") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   """,1.0

 I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly:
 UNSD uses the term  """"statistics divisions""""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.)
 You still prefer previous title (i.e. """"United Nations statistical divisions"""") to the current one (i.e. """"United Nations geoscheme"""")?
If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following:
 The term """"Statistics Division""""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org.
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term """"statistical divisions"""", or the wrong organization term  """"Statistics Division"""" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). 

I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as """"UN geoscheme"""". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:
""""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""""
""""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""""
""""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""""
""""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""""
""""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""""

I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different """"statistical divisions"""" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term """"UN geoscheme"""" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  """"UN geoscheme"""" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 .

""":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

 Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. 

 To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. 

 Saying that DLA has """" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"in major financial centres"""" or """"in major commercial centres"""" or """"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.

 I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

"You’ve mentioned that the particulars of the person or situation don’t matter but here is an extreme situation based on sadly common real life events: a person in an abusive relationship was told by their partner that they could not drink or wear certain clothes because they would “embarrass themselves.” In this instance, avoiding alcohol with the abused partner, whose normal alcohol intake was previously 1-2 drinks with other individuals who were also recreationally drinking and no solo drinking, would be complicit in engaging with the abusive partner’s controlling demands. This is a tricky situation - a morally gray area - where the assumptions underlying the drinking are particularly salient. In this case, offering a sip or one drink may be a fast way to challenge some of the assumptions underlying the refusal as well as model that the abusive partner does not necessarily control others’ behaviors.",3.042

But if we go through them properly, I think it will be possible to at least get enough information about notability and minimal biography. But the problem is that my Arabic is very very poor - All I can understand on reading nearly properly is the Qur-An. I tried Google translate as well, but the quality seems to be very poor. But I will try my best to do what I can to improve those articles. I used to work basically on Astronomy-related articles on Malayalam Wiki. I think this can be my major field of work here.
I agree with your view that we need more accessible information about all these individuals. But I am not sure whether Wikiipedia would be the right place for that. Perhaps, as you said, an extension...

After the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generation, Indigenous leader Max Dulumunmun Harrison, an elder of the Yuin people, helped bring it out last November, when he wrote: “I applaud the Prime Minister’s apology to our mob, but what about the white stolen generation that suffered the same fate?

That means that a company that's just recently started, that has never produced a product, and that, by the way those were written, seem closer to a group of friends, is not a suitable subject for a WP article. Basically, if you can't find a number of newspaper (etc.) articles discussing the company, it shouldn't have an article. I hope this explains why these articles were deleted.

Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the """"firearm experts"""" that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.  

M-W Dictionary:  When I say """"the dictionary"""" clearly I'm referring to """"the dictionary"""" I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a """"cognitive miser"""" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on """"the controversy"""" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  

Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to """"cartridge clips"""" as """"magazines"""".  The """"experts"""" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to """"magazines"""" as """"clips"""".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.

What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.

This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.

"(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page.  See Archive 9.  The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",1.0

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable). In fact, as you go through modern academic literature (the last 20 years), """"Holocaust"""" more and more includes non-Jewish victims. Just an example: Alex Callinicos, from York University, (2001) The Holocaust isfor good reasons I need not rehearse heregenerally held to be the most extreme case of human evil. All the different kinds of domination fused together in Auschwitzracism, directed at Jews, Slavs, and Roma; the economic exploitation of slave labour; the oppression of gays and women; the persecution of dissenting minorities such as Communists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Or Slawomir Kapralski, """"Identity Building and the Holocaust: Roma Political Nationalism."""" I have already mentioned Sybil Milton (who was a senior historian at the Research Institute of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum), and Henry Friedlander, a leading Holocaust historian in the USA, is another important voice. This increasing consensus has had an impact on common language , as well on political bodies. See this press release from the UN, for instance. It is not a question of ranking victimsit is the concept of hte holocaust as a racist, mordern project, and the common fate of the victims. The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

JanetteDoe, I appreciate your finding and uploading the Rao articles.  However, this can easily become an endless discussion.  For some other Yadav-apologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao, and then you—conscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention, aware or unaware, of being—will go scurrying again for the article.  After that we all will try to interpret it, weighing the pros and cons, again to a degree the apologists will not, for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path.  

I think we can't make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not, at least not yet.  Let the secondary sources do that.  We need to rely on recent scholarship, especially that in textbooks, published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds.  Two such books, by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot, both widely used in universities around the world, both reviewed extensively in the literature, are being used in the article.  Let the article writing (or rewriting) proceed based on these (or similar) books.  Once the article has been fleshed out, we can come back to the issue of Rao.  Otherwise, nothing will get done, and those of us, who've taken time out from our other Wikipedia (not to speak RL) pursuits to attend to the article, will slowly walk away, out of touch and out of sympathy.  «Talk» """,1.0

Minor wording issue about steamboats
I'm doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence, from the Navigation section: The use of steamboats along the river, beginning in 1850... There is a footnote, to this timeline page, which phrases it """"1850: Steamboats Columbia and Lot Whitcomb begin regular service on the Columbia River."""" The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850, at least to Fort Vancouver. The first was the Beaver (steamship), which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836. I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river..., but that isn't quite right either because the Beaver was in """"regular use"""", even if its operations were not limited to the river. Anyway, I can't come up with a way to reword this bit, especially given the existence of the footnote, which does not mention the Beaver. So I'm just mentioning it here.

"""With over 100,000 college students studying abroad every year, there's bound to be all kinds of tall tales, urban legends, and misinformation swirling around.  While there may be grains of truth in some of these stories, below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.

Misconception #1: Studying abroad is very expensive.

Truth: In most cases, it is actually cheaper to study abroad.  Let's say the tuition at your school is $5,000 per semester and room and board is another $4,000.  Now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance, books, and laundry.  You are now well over $10,000 for the semester.  Well, all but one of our programs in Spain is under $10,000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.
TAB

Misconception #2: I can't use my financial aid to study abroad.

Truth: In almost all cases, your federal aid (Stafford loans, Pell grants, etc.) can be used to study abroad and in some states, you can use your state aid as well.  It is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.

Misconception #3: Host families are all poor and just do it for the money.

Truth: The last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program.  The goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had.  If we were putting students in bad families, in dangerous neighborhoods, then no one would ever recommend us to their friends.  Since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year, it's a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. 

Misconception #4: I'll be so busy with schoolwork that I won't get time to see the country I'm in.

Truth: This one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400+ photos from a long list of countries.  Students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.

Misconception #5: I might not graduate on time if I go abroad.

Truth: If you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses, then it's true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad.  If you plan ahead, however, and leave some electives open to you, then you should be fine.  The clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years, despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.

Misconception #6: Most of the world hates Americans, so I won't be safe.

Truth: There's no doubt that there are a lot of people who don't like the American government, but that has nothing to do with the American people.  If you compare the violent crime rate in the United States to that of European, Australian, or Asian countries, you will see that the United States is actually far more dangerous.  There are some areas of South America and Africa that are not especially safe, but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe.  Go to the U.S. State Department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.

Studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of.  Before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard, speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts.  I guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you, you'll be hopping the first flight abroad.

One organization that help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is Academic Studies Abroad.    Here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries:

-Study Abroad Spain- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Barcelona, Madrid, Salamanca and Sevilla.  

-Study Abroad England- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in London.  

-Study Abroad Italy - Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Florence.  

-Study Abroad France- Academic Studies offer study abroad programs in Aix-en-Provence and Avignon.

 2) Is it a functional link, and likely to continue being a functional link?

When in doubt about the appropriateness of adding new links, make a suggestion on the article's talkpage and discuss with other editors.

I am slowly working on many of the mountains of Washington.  I do one or two a day.
I have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created.  One is a list of highest points in each of Washington's 39 counties.  I research if they need disambiguation.  So for Big Horn mountain I had to research whether there were other things called Big Horn - there are tons of them.  As you can see there are hundreds of uses of Big Horn.  If I can, I find newspaper articles relating to the place.   But due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep, businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship... I have not been able to isolate one article about Big Horn.  Big Horn so far is not notable for much of anything besides being the highest point in Lewis County, Washington.

Hi there.  You may have noticed that I've been adding to the excellent article you created here - a few extra refs and some photographs, plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer.  (Oh, and I renamed it too!) Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment?  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status - I haven't done this before, but it seems to comply with the criteria (or to be nearly there, anyway).  What do you think?   

You baked the cake, I just added the icing!  Fingers crossed...  

 Oh dear...

Hello again.  The GA review picked up various points, some easy to fix, some not.  Anyway, I've had a go and fixing things and I think it could do with your further attention to see whether you can spot anything that I've missed, particularly points 1, 5 and 7.  Then perhaps it'll get its GA badge!  

Great work.  I've renominated it and left a message for our previous reviewer, as he offered to look at it again if nobody else did whilst he was away.

Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this """"indigenous"""" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""""

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang.  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject.  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors.  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS.

 European Borders 

There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not .As you know there is no official border between europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page..........      well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she """"thinks it is the most neutral one"""". I am sorry but what some users """"think"""" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border ! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european,  country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only european countries are eligible for it according  to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. Turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the EU. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included.

"Senior descendant of Victoria & Albert? 

Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.",1.0

"""=""""color:#4682b4"""">Coldplay Expért]] Let's talk 
This talk page is for discussing the article, not World War II history in general.   

 Summary of Consequences 

I believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events, and in a summary article, one must summarize the consequences. My edit, stating that """"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"""" is a factual statement. This is not """"Stalin's arguments"""" this is not a """"Soviet Apologist stance"""" this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. In the Spanish Civil War the Red Army fought side by side with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Prior to the Franco-British assisted Nazi Sudetenland Grab, relations between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union were icy. When the Nazis were declaring war on Czechoslovakia, the USSR was hard at work putting together an anti-Nazi coalition. Only after seeing the British and French backed down in the face of naked anti-Slavic aggression, did the Soviets begin to look for other allies. There is no mass conspiracy here, as the search began right after the event. This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts. If there are no more objections, I will reinsert the statement into the article, as it is merely cause and effect.   
Respectfully disagree. The statement """"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"""" pretends to describe a casual linkage, although in actuality, the linkage was not so obvious, and the scholars' opinion on that vary dramatically. One school thinks that the only and sincere Soviet Union's desire was to establish a collective security system and an anti-Hitler's coalition. Another school believes that the only Stalin's aim was the alliance with Hitler. The third version (the most reasonable, in my opinion) is that the USSR was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most European powers (that was, at least partially, justified), and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against Germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers (and, to expand its territory). The statement you tried to introduce into the article is a POV of the leftist part of the first group scholars. We cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. We have either to tell a full story (that is impossible because of space limitations) or to abstain from any interpretations.Interestingly, your statement may be even simply incorrect, because, according to my sources, Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the USSR, UK and France, and could lead to signing of Anti-Hitler triple alliance. In only a month after occupation of Czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. Had Chamberlain and Stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other, and had Ribbentrop been little bit less active, WWII could be prevented.Re: """"This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts."""" No. All these facts had already been in the article before your edits. Your wording looks like a description of motives, not statement of facts.If you still disagree, try to propose another wording that takes into account all what I wrote. In addition, a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. Try to follow this unwritten rule. That saves a lot of time and efforts.  
As there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of World War II and Wikipedia's guidelines require that all non-fringe views be given equal weight, it isn't feasible for this high-level article to discuss casual links between events.   
What Nick said, also the USSR wanting to be neutral argument falls apart, because historical evidence clearly shows that had France honored its alliance with Czechoslovakia, USSR would have intervened as well. USSR secured a passage from Romania in order to assist Czechoslovakia. USSR placed all of its divisions west of the Urals on High Alert. After the seizure of Czechoslovakia, the USSR held the UK partially responsible, and frankly did not trust them, or the French, as allies. If France failed to uphold their defensive treaty with Czechoslovakia, why would a defensive treaty with USSR",1.0

Please consult the article Ball culture, which states """"drag queen, or transgendered"""". WP:OR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together.  As well, the term """"Femme queen"""" does not have an article, so the term is currently of dubious usage as it's a neologism, (which WP policy suggests to avoid using).  You state a source: """"TGMSMNET"""", however neither this page, nor the mainpage refer to such a reference.  From the way you talked about it, I linked it to the """"MSTSW"""" reference.

However, we still have issue... how would the CDC consider a post-op MTF living in stealth as anything else but a """"female""""... the MTF would obviously not admit to being a transsexual, and in fact engages in no activity any more risky than a """"biological"""" female.  (I wait for further evidence that TG/TS is caused by biological factors, and thus the term """"biological male/female"""" becomes complicated in even research... no one would ever state that a woman with CAIS is """"biologically"""" a male...)

"""

This is untrue.  I have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons, since the reasons mentioned are not actually true.  It is impossible to """"exhibit a battleground attitude"""" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot """"exhibit"""" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to """"exhibit"""" anything let alone a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as an """"attitude"""" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word """"exhibit"""" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED """"help desk"""" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly """"myself making it difficult to communicate,"""" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"""" is impossible since 1) """"guidelines"""" and """"rules"""" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was """"done in multiple venues,"""" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.                       """,1.0

""":::::You resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile Binksternet.
For starters, dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009, while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1, he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo, to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. As i'm saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed, no decision was made and the discussion ended. Paulh, or you did not say anything. If he wanted the photo then, why didn't he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? I would've left it at that then, but instead he and other editors remained silent. I didn't restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest, or didn't have the time.

Furthermore, I did not """"slip in"""" as you disgustingly, dishonestly, facetiously say. I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January. Again, no one did anything for months. You and Paulh cannot claim you didn't see the change, because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.

Again, Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change, or continue the discussion where it had left off. Once again, he instead changed the photo, got a """"consensus"""" from Binksternet. The IP editor liked the photo, but, quoting the editor again:

""""Any of the photos in that section (""""FinancialNorth.jpg""""; """"Montgomerystreetsf.jpg""""; """"Federal Reserve Band (San Francisco).jpg"""") except #2 (SanFranciscoEmbarcadero.jpg) would be fine as a replacement, and even the cropped version of #2 is better than the one currently there now. Thoughts?64.81.57.93 (talk)""""

""""I'm going to replace it with """"FinancialNorth.jpg"""" and see what happens.""""

The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it, or I or other editors could respond.

Binksternet's abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. Despite my reverts, I at least agreed to having a discussion and a """"photo choosing contest"""" as it were. Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. I don't see Binksternet asking the IP editor in question or other editors to the SF article including Optigan13 have their say either in this. He is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus, something that at least Paulh did earlier. Only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.

Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).

:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",1.0

The organization of sub-topics. Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate. The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive.

"""As for the change in """"Romanian"""" to """"Reich"""", yes it is difficult to work out what Caldwell is referring to. It seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in W.Germany (not Polesti). RAF Bomber Command used an attack by the 8AF to attack this target.
The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your """"give me a quote"""" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the """"oil"""" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med. Theatre). So your generalisation of a """"quote"""", if this indeed is what it is, makes the Bulk of the German fighter force concentrated in Romania false.

Are the Departments of Honduras defined geographically, like the states of Mexico, or the Lands of Germany, or even the states in the United States?

When can one Department of Honduras exercise authority over another Department of Honduras?

Does the constitution of Honduras subscribe to any theory of jurisdiction when it comes to organizing its departments, and is the jurisdiction of one Department explicitly limited by a specific border or boundary with another?

If an individual (or his property) is taken into custody in one Department, is there a hearing before a magistrate (as one would expect in a civil code country) before he (or the thing he has an interest in) is extradited to another Department?

I think the main article could be improved by explaining when one Department can exercise jurisdiction over an individual or corporation doing business in the area of a particular Department, and when it is supposed to refrain from exercising that authority.216.99.201.180",1.0

Hello, JOptionPane. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one.

After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit.

Words of Encouragement to user """"Damemk"""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".
User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

"""::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an """"academic"""" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

"""== OldLady Productions ==

History 

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released

- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !
- Ryan V.S Marco
- Nothing
- Fashion Show 08
- Ryan V.S Marco ( part 2 )
- Effects of Bullying
- What happens when you don't play fair !
- The Amazing Jog of 2008
- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this.

I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.

Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote """"well sourced"""" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not """"well sourced"""".

"Section 'Subdivisions' should be more than a list. 

I hate to complain about a problem, rather than just fix the problem, but I really don't know enough about biology to be productive here.

The Problem: I read eudicots, rosids, and asterids.  Although each article lists some representative species, I (the reader) have no understanding what criteria was used to subdivide eudicots into rosids and asterids (and others).  Why is one plant a rosid but not an asterid?  These articles read as though plant life is subdivided arbitrarily, though I suspect the subdivision is somewhat rational.  My intuition tells me that there must be some expressible, meaningful distinction between these subgroups.

The Proposal: Is there some way to describe the grouping here?   I propose a brief summary of the characteristics which divide rosids and asterids.  I think this summary should be a list of differences, each difference taking this form:
 Rosids feature X.  In contrast, Asterids feature Y.

 Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona 

Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you.  

 Peter III of Aragon 

What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what """"contemporary"""" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:
it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime
the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might
the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format
it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait
the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative
what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king

In your last edit summary, you ask """"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"""", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   

Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.

You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.

I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.

If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.  

I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?   

Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?  
Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.   
Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.  

 Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia 

I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring.

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

Promoting industries that provide fair and equitable livelihoods for impoverished communities can lead to major conservation outcomes via environmental protectionism and stewardship if the  harvest or exploitation is subsistent and reliant on a stable ecology.

The question of women wearing pants came to mind because of the probability that the decree attributed to Pope Linus is aprocryphal. The letter of Pope Nicholas I is certainly genuine.  I should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are, I think, less likely to go to Mass wearing pants than without a veil, and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil.  If the pants question disappears from the footnote, I will certainly consider putting it in the body of the article.

"Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre-torture versions  of what the camp did.",1.0

"""Note from the subject book::

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

 musings 

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!

i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.  

""""mere editors"""" really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.

a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like """"disruption"""" is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the """"trust admins to do what is right"""".   it has failed.

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

You can go count the number of rebates on TigerDirect.com and you'll find less there than you find on Amazon or Newegg or any of TigerDirect.com's other competitors.   Regarding the attorney general's complaint, you also have to note that in response to the complaint Tigerdirect argued that it's not true.   If you want to state that a company has used rebates in its marketing and has had public complaints about the fulfillment of those rebates then you can create a blanket statement and apply it to pretty much every computer and CE reseller in the country.

With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",1.0

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs

 Protection  

This article is starting to get vandilized again. If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected. I wonder why vandilism is returning to it. Get over it people, the superbowl's over!!!

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: """"Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.  I think it warrants another sentence or 2 or at least the deletion of the word """"howev",1.0

"""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.

The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:
""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. 

The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.

Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.

Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

You guys might want to broaden your horizons a bit by looking across the Atlantic. There is quite a successful model in many European countries when it comes to healthcare. In Germany we believe that capitalism needs to be regulated by the state because markets do not solve all problems. It is called social market economy an works quite well since the second work war. We have a healthcare system for everyone and free university education! The funny thing is that the money to start this system came from the us marshal plan after ww2 since America was afraid west Germany would turn a communist country if the markets are not somehow regulated. You will find similar systems in Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.For us Europeans it is very difficult to understand how a first world country cannot provide healthcare for all of its citizens.,3.042

"Spanking exists to cut corners on good parenting. Not saying that all parents who spank their kids are monsters or even necessarily ""bad"" parents, but spanking is only a lazy ""tool"" (for lack of a better word) to get around remedying a kid's behavior in the long run.
Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head. Obviously this is an oversimplification because parenting is a very complicated process, but studies show that spanking is not beneficial and can actually cause harm.",3.2560000000000002

">I define God as the greatest conceivable being.

This can actually be proof that that God doesn't exist. I can prove this through the sheer power of numbers. Greatest implies a sense of quantity. If we posited any being that we might call God, who took up any infinite amount of space (just for one possible value of ""greatest"") then I can conceive a larger infinity that that being could fill, thus making that God fall short of that standard. Anything that is quantifiable, I can conceive of something larger than what actually exists, just by adding 1 to it.

So, if we're arguing that God, I can say that any being will fall short of that because of the nature of infinities and the infinite number of infinities and some infinities being larger than other infinities.",3.084
"Lol, you know what i meant. Whichever president came before Hafez (i just new he was president before assad) has considerable foreground of support, in which his supports would have freaked out because of the coup. They would have claimed instability would arise, as assad's supporters are trying to use in their defense. 

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected.  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).",1.0

 Template:Infobox Network 

Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability. Request: Is it possible to further modify the code, so an editor has the option of employing the infobox without using a header at all? (See, for example, the use of Infobox Biography in Henry Cowell.) When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the """"name"""" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether.

 Obviously there is some anti-Americanism in Canada. This means nothing, necessarily, with regards to the structure of this article. I was referring to the specific idea that Canadian students fear their sovereignty will be overwhelmed, or that Canadians consider themselves cultural correctives to Americans. And I asked for another side of the story, and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. Your response here is confusing. As far as """"citing my sources"""", I am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article, not making additions to the article. Several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim anti-Americanism on the basis of involvement in the Middle-East... that doesn't mean it's a relevant enough addition to put into the INTRODUCTION of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world, that is meant to specifically talk about the MAJOR issues between two specific countries. 

As far as your sources go, you did not comment on the obscurity of them. You have still not properly defended James Tagg (yes, that was me who removed that a year ago). I don't see why you get to just dub a source """"reliable"""", when I thoroughly explained why I determined it """"unreliable"""" (or, rather, inappropriate to add). I read that source, left you detailed comments, and you said something like """"Don't POV push"""" and reverted my edits. You are not making an argument here. (re: Culture Clash in Archive 2)

Again, there are two sides to every story. Please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. Many Canadians would laugh at the idea that the USA causes a """"profound fear"""" that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed (and why do students' opinions have so much weight, by the way?). But there likely won't be many sources to support this, because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldn't exist for a counter argument. Nevertheless, I'll take a look...

One last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality, and onesideness breaching neutrality. I am not trying to say that what you're saying is not true at all. I'm sure it is true the the extent that it is. But how much is that?

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.

With all respect, I don't know why people only warn against personal attacks by one editor, in a dispute where rules are clearly being broken all around.

Any normal person in Chussid's position would find this behavior extremely aggravating and would very likely resort to personal attacks, which is exactly why this kind of behavior is not allowed.

 The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the """"purple patch that began with...,"""" etc.  This seems clear to me.

Blu,

I noticed you changed the logo for the Ubuntu Linux User Box.  Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about """"fair use"""" images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy. The Ubuntu trademark policy may allow it, but Wikipedia policy (per WP:FU is to limit images that are not available for commercial use - which the Ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows.  | (talk) | (contribs)  The preceding text was copied from User talk:Jcarroll

I didn't know previously about your project to clean up China-related categories.  Cleaning and reorganizing categories is one of my favorite Gnome-like tasks to do on WP.  What specific changes did you have in mind?

I really should help out more at FAC.  Sometimes I just don't want to read all the way through an article.  Lazy, I know.  I'll look into conflict mediation too.

"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

You do not have to rate the article if you do not want to, others will do it eventually. Those templates are very useful, as they bring the articles to a WikiProject attention, and allow them to start tracking the articles through Wikipedia:Article alerts and other tools.

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the """"data of consciousness"""" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. I'm quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any Jesuit schools would consider his work """"notable"""".

Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation).

Nobody really attacked me before I revealed my age here.  After I announced that I was 14, I was subject to a constant storm of harassment and abuse.

PLEASE DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS NOTE. THE WHOLE SUPRA-SECTION WILL DISAPPEAR AGAIN ONCE I AM ABLE TO POST ON THE ARTICLE TALK PAGE.

This includes you Shell. Had you not blocked me, I would have been able to place my answers there. This will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.

Because Shell falsely blocked me, I cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. Hence I will save the entire page (minus the archived sections) here.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

I wonder what would be your NPOV version of the following article: Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last Prophet and Messenger of the monotheistic Abrahamic tradition, and that the Quran is the last revelation of God.

 Can someone explain criticism #6 to me? 

This is taken from the criticisms section of the article:

6. Since logic is inherently constant, and that some things are more true than others, it means that """"strong"""" relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. Relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. An example of a similar phenomenon is the Gay Marriage debate in the U.S. - an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. 

Can someone explain what exactly this means? 
I do not follow the first half of the paragraph (the one that actually pertains to relativism), and the example reads as complete nonsense to me, especially this part:

""""...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.""""

I do not think that:
a) The majority in question believes that """"it"""" doesn't apply to them. (Though I'm not sure what """"it"""" is in this context, so the sentence may be true.) The majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society, which, of course, applies to everybody in that society.
b) The majority in question does not """"weigh up the effects of its views"""". Its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed, for the benefit of society; it is aware of the effects; and does not object to them.  """,1.0

"Italian Renaissance as a featured article ==

Before getting to the substance of my comment, let me just thank you for all the work you've done for Wikipedia; users like you are such an asset to the project. I do have one minor critique to make, though... I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status, but at the time, I had an actionable (and in my view appropriate) objection. (Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.  talk

Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts? You know if we wrote that The Urantia Book is an epochal revelation containing religio-scientific cosmology... there would then start more POV debating.  00:34, 16",1.0

HP Pavilion at San Jose hosts an average of 190 events a year, including many non-sporting events. In 2006, the HP Pavilion sold the most tickets to non-sporting events of any venue in the Western United States, and the fourth highest total in the world, after Madison Square Garden in New York City, the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester, and the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.

The arena regularly hosts concerts by numerous performers and has played host for major sporting events, such as the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the NCAA Basketball tournament (known as March Madness), the Pac-10 women's basketball championship, and the Dew Action Sports Tour.

HP Pavilion has been rumored to be the new home of the Sacramento Kings NBA franchise if the city of Sacramento or a private developer can't come up with funding for a new venue in Sacramento.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"no original research"""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"warts and all"""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - 

""""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective. 

 Bauer 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   
 I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. 

""""or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""""

I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule.

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character.

 MediaWiki:Duplicate-defaultsort 

Do you realize what a wonderful thing this is?  When you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created?  I hope not because I have been, although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under """"S"""" and """"T"""" while I finish """"L"""" and do """"M"""" through """"R"""" I will not complain.

When I stumbled across the category there were 2,777 pages in it.  By the end of today there will be fewer than 1,000.  My goal is to get all the non-trivial items resolved by the end of next week so I can start on the pages in Category:Biography articles without listas parameter, a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life.  

Because I am resolving the conflicts in the first category I have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks, like you, who know why the banners work as they do.  I have also leaned what items can set the DEFAULTSORT. As an added bonus I have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts I did not know before and I have become almost addicted to Preview.

The absolutely best part about the Dup-DS is that the category it has created, that I will continue to monitor on a daily basis, is a safety net for me when I mess something up on a page in  Category:Biography articles without listas parameter.  The easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it, wants it, and will throw a fit if it is not there.

As can be seen, I have added a new history section for the Bank of Liverpool - previously there were just a few lines of intro. I have taken it up to 1918, when the Bank acquired Martins Bank and became the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.

I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.

How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article. One solution would be to have Martins pre-1918 history as a self-contained article with the Bank of Liverpool article continuing up to 1969.",1.0

To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",1.0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on """"the history of science"""" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).
 

 period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

Some people want everything to belong to one race or another. For example I saw latina women mad because women of other races were wearing hoop earrings. Earrings!!! Things like that are not cultural appropriation. Its not cultural. 
Something that is appropriation is using religious symbols as fashion. Or taking something and lessoning its value. For example, bindis. They are a religious piece of great importance they aren’t a part of fashion. 
I feel like for it to be appropriation the value or perceived value has to be changed. Earrings mean as much to a black person as the do to a white person. A traditional headdress means something of deep value. Someone who isnt native wearing cheapens its value and makes it seem worthless

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",1.0

Hi again Cat, 

as perviously I have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've had issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever)

This is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?)

"""

 as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib) 

 (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)

 So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? 

 Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: 

  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) 

 Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. 

 And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. 

 I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? 

 Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. 

 Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:

Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)

 You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  

 In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""". 

 And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling. Why would you need to state such a thing, if not for the possibility that you might have s",1.0

From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"""" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be """"a little awkward"""" for him back in Washington.""""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook. And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"""" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' """" he said.""""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"""" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""""D."""")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s. Before that, the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century, he said.link  17:36""",1.0

Same for married women, if, let's say, her husband has let himself go and she just doesn't fancy him any more for sex, but he's still useful for putting shelves up.

Wives do not 'allow' husbands to do things, and vice versa. Marriage is a partnership. If one side of that partnership is not happy with an aspect of it, they need to discuss it.

If one partner (wife or husband) wants to sleep with other people, and the other is ok with it then fine.

Paganism

Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94

This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97

Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102

This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104

 Free Software / Open Source 

In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase """"free and open source"""". 
The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection. If the developers use """"free software"""" it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. If the developers of a certain program use only """"open source"""" and the license of the program is indeed an open source license (Excluding the GNU GPL.

For reference, I will repost and expand them here.

1. Jimbo Wales has to leave. He should turn over the server admin passwords to a professional, 
responsible IT person who is salaried by the WMF.
 
2. Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. 
Changes would include but not be limited to:

   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.

   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO. 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking
      to write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. """"Assume good faith"""" my ass.

   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.

3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
banned from WP PERMANENTLY. This would include but not be limited to:
    FT2
    Durova
    David Gerard
    JzG
    MONGO

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone.

She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance 
to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts 
for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

Me and your daughter.. got a special thang goin on
You say it's puppy love (arf arf arf)
We say it's full grown (ARF ARF WOOF!)
Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls 
done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more 
cause my dick all in her mouth
You know what I'm talking about Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, and D to the G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

Admin input:
If you were in communication with an admin, and were actively working on it, you (or the admin) should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. Quite frankly, I don't believe the draft article you're working on is ready to go for the following reasons: 
There's a number of grammar and spelling errors 
Headers should not have caps except for first letter, and should not be wikilinks 
Bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only 
References shouldn't be generalized like you've put them. Individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references (see WP:FN and WP:CITET if you don't know how to do this) 
The section on """"Search engine submission software"""" should be omitted entirely, as it's covered in a separate article. Don't duplicate material, that's what wiki links are for 
Move the reasons why its notable (media coverage, awards) to the 1st or 2nd paragraph 
Please be aware that wikipedia is not a how-to guide, so instructional information about how to use the software is not appropriate. 
You can eliminate the """"further reading"""", as the book is in the refs (and get rid of the dummies graphic - it's not relevant to the particular program...it looks like you're plugging the book). AKRadeckiSpeaketh

He might not be technically banned, but as long as he continues to do the same thing he should be treated as if he were. I don't know how else to deal with this.

 Heisenberg's Scientific Method

With due respect to Heisenberg and his contribution to science, I don not mean to use wikipedia to express my ideas and opinions about the works of any indvidual.I have only stated some of the limitations of Heisenberg's works with due references and just brought out a fact how Heisenberg's method is unable to resolve the mystery of scarcity of dineutrons and in a way """"lope-sidedness"""" of our universe.
I just disaggree with you whether not this is is a good addition to wikipedia. On the other hand, I also disagree with the block you received resp. the unblock denied and have raised that point.

 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life!

"A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies 
Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.

(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )",1.0

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.
For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

 - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful.
 - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual.

This includes sections 1 and 2 of the current Equalization filter  along with possible future articles tone controls, loudness control (combine with Smiley face), speaker equalization etc. Oh, I'm certainly not saying that these need to be separate articles, but could as well be topics in one article (except that a few of these already exist separately). The article should mention that """"equalization"""" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.

Then there should be an article which discusses actual channel equalization (or some such term) which WOULD include section 3 of Equalization filter (Telecommunications lines), RIAA equalization, FM pre/de-emphasis as well as equalization of non-audio channels; this is the orginal meaning of """"equalization""""). Such equalizers are generally non-adjustable (by a user, at least) and transparent to the end user. So I call it a different subject, even when it IS audio.

The removed paragraph 
Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic

I have removed this paragraph, not because I would necessarily disagree, but because this is a speculative formulation (a """"POV"""" in wikipedia terminology) not suitable for an encyclopaedia.

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,1.0

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand

 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on. I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting. Respond if you have anything to say.   """,1.0

 Good policy suggestion on class assignments. 

My sympathies about your encountering a class assignment that has gone badly awry. I think your  looks like a good idea, and I support it. It's especially regrettable that we are not receiving more well sourced, thoughtful edits to psychology articles here, as most of those articles badly need better sourcing and more coherent editing to represent current established knowledge from a neutral point of view. Keep up the good work.   (talk, ) 

 An appology is in order 

Dear Colin,

I am not sure if you will have the chance to read this, or if you'll have a moment to respond, but I am a student in the University of Toronto and specifically one of the 1700 psychology students mentioned in the article.  However before I go any further, may I express my most sincere and deepest appologies to you and everyone involved. I will not try to make excuses for my actions, nor will I try to do so for my fellow students as I do not speek for them. I realise (and no doubt others will too) that what we left behind was unbecoming of a sutdent at U of T.  And most importantly, I realise that we did as future scholars was wrong.

I know that you and you colleagues are considering taking extreme measures to ensure the content of Wikipedia stays secure as a responce to our actions. Though I can understand where you are coming from, I do not believe that this will solve any of your problems and will only make things worse in the long-run.  I see this situation as a systemic error on both of our sides, but as a first year student I have very little educational and social clout to enforce my statement. I am asking as both an avid reader of Wikipedia and as a lover of knowledge, please do not black-out our privaleges to use and edit articles.  Let us both use this experience as a steping stone to learn how to go about doing this in a constructive manner benefits Wikipedia and my school. 
 
Looking to make this a better place,

CivCodex 
  
Thanks. We have no issues with people who are interested in Wikipedia coming to edit Wikipedia. What seems to be the issue is when we have a large group of students editing Wikipedia not for the love of knowledge but simply for marks. These students do not stay around and seem to plagiarize at a high rate.   (talk · contribs · email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 
Have replied on your talk page. °Talk 

 Proposed new policy  

I'd like to advertise this (very draft) proposed new policy: . 

Comments please. °Talk 
 I think the central dillema is this: a student could make a poor-quality contribution that harms Wikipedia but then recieve partial or full credit. If the grading rubric was accurate, a student would receive 0 or negative credit. My personal solution has been to engage with professors to try and influence the assignment, increase their Wikipedia knowedge, and improve the grading rubrics themselves. I'm fairly proud of Education Program:Saint Louis University/Signal Transduction (SP13), which I helped write. You might want to ask   

 There should also be some sort of policy re: how the community reacts to profs and students.  The active community is more likely to be aware of and act on policies, in the first place; and we are often more unkind than necessary, in the second.  
 I proposed an alternative idea on the assignments talk page - as an example of the sort of implementation that I would hope is compatible with any policy we adopt.  –  +

"Jung And Einstein 

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",1.0

 Some tips for making your stubs a bit better 

Apart from your over-reliance on Soccerway (which isn't always a WP:RS), I've noticed there are some other aspects of your created articles which need substantial improvement. Typing """"player who plays"""" is poor English, try to put """"footballer who plays..."""" or """"soccer player who represents..."""" The word """"currently"""" is pretty pointless too - I mean, they either play for the team or they don't, right? Also, try not to say they play for Bayern Munich in the Frauen-Bundesliga. Put of the Frauen-Bundesliga instead, because they play matches for their teams outside the league too. Please remember to always put the stub tags at the bottom of the article, this will draw attention to the fact that your creations require expansion and improvement. These are just small suggestions, but hopefully by taking this advice you will get better and eventually take some steps on the path to becoming a worthwhile contributor. Thanks,   """,1.0

Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole """"Living Dangerously"""" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the """"G30S"""" forces and those loyal to Suharto. I'm of the opinion that the period of combat was brief, and that after Jakarta was seized by Nasution-Suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided - hence, why the PKI's Central Committee-in exile called it just a """"White Terror."""" 

But of course, however, the same group criticized Aidit for not adhering to Mao's """"People's War"""" doctrine - so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the PKI that were spoiling for a conflict. Hence, I titled it Indonesian Civil War rather than Indonesian White Terror or Indonesian Coup - it keeps things NPOV and open to different scholarly interpretations.

By, I should point out that I have an interesting hard copy """"self critical"""" document the PKI Central Committee published from China detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in '65 and attempts to re-establish the Party. Unfortunately, it is without copyright information printed (this was likely due to attempts to get around import restrictions during the U.S. Cold War).

Speedy deletion of Spunga
 A tag has been placed on Spunga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...).

 Naji al-Ali 

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is """"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - """"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"""" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."""" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying """"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

 stradbroke galleon / portuguese 

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    """,1.0

""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. 

On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.

Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  
Survey
Add """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~
 Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.

 Unfair Accusation of Spamming?

I feel that my addition of external links to the Wikipedia pages """"Genesis creation narrative,"""" """"Ibbur,"""" and """"Gilgul"""" have been unfairly flagged for inappropriate activity. The external links added are primary source texts directly related to the Wikipedia page subject . They are not commercial or ideological. Please advise.

I removed them because they linked to a blog and blogs are not considered reliable sources for Wikipedia, if you feel they are a special case you could discuss on the article talk pages. This link may be helpful links normally to be avoided All good wishes

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1.6666666666666665

Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about """"between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"""", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.

Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.

It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony. Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones. I'm aware of the substantial history of Iona-based clerics in Bernicia, but times change (and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons).

The translation of Pehthelm's name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flat-out, so have a look at the reference cited; I tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed, you should be able to quickly access every citation that I made in the article.

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

""""Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented; his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay. Upon escaping the vile pervert, they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do.""""

Myths:

""""It is said that Jacques de Molay cursed Philippe le Bel and his descent from his execution pyre, a curse which was responded to by Philip shouting in defiance """"Fuck de Molay!""""""""

""""It has been speculated that several of the boys whom de Molay had corrupted had grown to enjoy the perversions of the homosexual lifestyle introduced to them""""

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go.

[Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too.

Also note that on every single edit page, there's a big statement saying """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""  Part of the """"edited mercilessly"""" part is that people will criticize your writing.  It's nothing personal.

""""If you see no evidence that Kinzer's book brought about a massive reassessment of the 1953 coup in Iran, then you did not read the book or the reviews.""""

Amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is, merely how good one is.  But whatever, you didn't include a direct mention in the most recent version, so let's just drop this.  (And for about the billionth time, since you mention in my edit summary that I'm """"criticizing"""" Kinzer....  I'm doing no such thing.  I'm sure the book is very good, judging from the review given by the CIA history fellow.  But """"very good"""" is not the same as """"an element of crowning importance in the coup itself.""""  People knew after 1979 that something had gone horribly wrong, so this was not a new revelation.

""""Aggression aside, SnowFire, the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing"""" 

You said earlier that """"Your other comments are too general to address. If you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording, feel free to bring it here for comment.""""  I decided to expand on the many problems with the lede, and now it's a """"windy"""" analysis.  Got it.  But aside from sniping, you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing.  It has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede.  There are a million and one possible, sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede; we have to pick which ones.  I have no doubt that your text was sourced; it doesn't mean it's automatically appropriate for the lede.

Yes, and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. Fast and loose with facts,

Let me say it again: Are you denying that Cold War paranoia had anything to do with the coup?  Do you realize what references are for?  It's to confirm facts.  This fact is obvious and supported by every source, including your own, so it doesn't particularly matter what it was referenced to.  If you want to source it better have a blast, but this is not even close to """"fast and loose with the facts.""""

Albright's """"apology""""

You've got a point that the linked NYTimes article doesn't call it apology.  Remember, I didn't write the old lede!  Fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we'd like.

The CIA does cite vague fear of the Soviet Union in its most recent justification for the coup. However, the CIA's accounting, published in 2007, three years after the publication of Kinzer's path-breaking book (2003), must be weighed against the CIA's destruction of most of its documents related to this coup

Wait, the CIA destroyed the documents, so therefore the Soviet Union had nothing to do with it?  That logic doesn't flow.  More to the point, the idea that Cold War machinations were behind the US involvement is in literally every source.  I haven't read All the Shah's Men, but from your linked book review (the one by a notable person, not from Amazon reviewers), it seems to be in that, too!  I quote..

Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by Moscow's machinations.

Kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic John Foster and a cynical Allen.

By ignoring the anticommunist basis of US policy, he wrenched the dispute with the AIOC out of its Cold War context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. Lastly, Mossadeq's naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the Tudeh Party's efforts to penetrate and control Iranian institutions. He seemed almost blithely unaware that pro-Soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of Eastern Europe. By not reining in Iran's communists, he fell on Washington's enemies list. https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html

....yeah.  As a reminder this is from a review of your favored source.  (Also note that Dulles is described as """"moralistic,"""" i.e. interested in stopping the communists, not greedy / interested in oil.  Squares with what I know of Dulles anyway.)

My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences. That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.

All of my references are verifiable.There's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.

I don't believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan't really hide that.   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words """"pro se"""" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is """"soap boxing"""". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I've been an entrepreneur. 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions.  """,1.0

"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.

Hi Tom, I understand and you don't have to convince me of the similarities, it's just that WP requires citations to reliable sources, in this case where the author of a book or a music paper article or a professional website like AllMusic has made the connection.

With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers.

I'm sorry but that reads ridiculous and has no sources to any of those claims. Who has widely praised her? Who says she is important? And the word reportedly, reportedly by whom? Where is a source for her nickname? Is her pageboy bob really trademarked?

Also the following-She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era.

So she was a newspaper consultant? I find it hard to believe that her Father,a grown man, would consult a youth on how to make a newspaper relevant to anyone. Where are sources for this? I guess I will start looking for sources and removing non sourced statements tomorrow. If anyone wants to help please help me.

I'd like to hear feedback from you, so that I can get help in improving this (and other Marx Brothers films) quality.
Princess Leia Organa. I've listed this article for peer review because it right now seems oddly cluttered and, despite a lot of references as of now, lacks reliable source citations.  Although I've already requested another peer review, as long as it helps the articles get better, I've got the time. Any helpful comments will certainly be appreciated, as this should help me in expanding other Star Wars-centric articles.

 Yeah I think general summaries are ok as long as they are actual summaries of multiple authors, aren't just mere repetitions of the author's statement and don't elongate the paragraph more unnecessarily. Also I'll like to point out these mistakes in your comment:
""""2) per Eliade, approximative understanding, partly of apparently non-Arabian rites, so not much;""""
Eildae never says it was non-Arabian. She's talking about Monophysite rites and Monophysite was the largest branch of Christianity in Arabia.

 """"3) per Watt, details that may be surmised by close analysis Muhammad's life;""""
He also argues that these verses might be attacking Christian heresies rather than orthodox beliefs. 

Also in the final I'll like to say again the subject of the article isn't about Quran and it's historicity and interpretations. So adding more and more unnecessary arguments and interpretations makes the paragraph stray too far from the topic and unnecessarily elongates the paragraph with needless irrelevant text.   """,1.0

Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue.

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?'

"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.",1.0

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,1.0

 Explanation 

Dear EDJohnston and Bearian, I am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in Wikipedia pages.
Here in UST Global wikipedia page I update the latest information regarding UST Gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category.

1) Under Corporate Milestones: Company achievements needs to be listed.
2) The link http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931 may have the recent major information about UST Global, but the top part of the page that mentions about """"Key Executives"""" is totally wrong. Two people and their postions who are not part of UST Global is being mentioned here.
3) UST Global is a Company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key roles/posts (during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this Company related records), but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with UST Global. This is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policy

Please advice me if i am wrong in my understanding.

Thank you,
Chellappa.M

 This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article 

Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word """"x86"""", for the following reasons:

1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally """"x86"""" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with """"86"""", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as """"x86"""" are IA-32 compatible software, and use """"x64"""" or """"x86-64"""" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. 

2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?

3. """"x86"""" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! """"x86"""" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the """"implementation"""" of this """"architecture""""?   """,1.0

Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",1.0

The bad aspects of cultural appropriation are when you misrepresent the culture in malicious ways that take away from the nature of that culture. However, that is most often done either in ignorance or hatred that's often fueled by racism. 

When you attempt to experience culture with genuine intent, I can't see any harm as long as you maintain an ability to take advice or criticisms from people of that culture in order to better experience their culture. Everything else is a societal/personal issue that just becomes more apparent while that person shares their view of another culture.",3.084

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""

Dear Wikipedia,

I am glad that you have included a section for opposition forums to the GMC to appear on your website. I had earlier thought of stopping my donations to Wikipedia over your failure to acknowledge the Abolish the GMC group - but will now continue to support your cause because I am now satisfied that your inclusion of them now shows you to be fair.

 Response to third opinion request:Hi, I'm here to give your third opinion.  I think it's important to keep in mind that this article is titled """"Common English usage misconceptions"""".  It's not """"Common English mistakes according to professional typography standards"""".  It is clear - to me at least - that the hypen is often misused.  There's no dash key on my keyboard.  I know how to make a dash, however, —.  But I do web dev and work for a printing company. And I just started a sentence with """"but"""", and this one with """"and"""".  I know all these things are wrong - but they are convenient - and I'm writing this somewhat humorous third opinion for a few guys on an article talk page.  So, in my mind, the question is whether this is a misconception, or just ignorance.  I believe that to properly call something a misconception, it must be believed to be a rule, when in fact such a rule is not correct.  I've never heard anyone say, """"just use hyphens for everything"""".  It has only become the default, because we have no dash keys.  So I would lean toward excluding this entry, unless you want to change the scope of the list to include all common mistakes, not just misconceptions.  Hope this helps.   """,1.0

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan 

Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me. This was the version at the time, that you based your post on. You posted:

 """"I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines... it is reliably sourced... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied... It now has 11 independent sources. And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised"""".

Please consider the concerns this post raises. Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin. In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I don't have a word for it. """"Unreal"""" is close.

The """"eleven independent sources"""" that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were:
 Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!)
 Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability.
 The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website].
 A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine (apparently) of the promoter's travels to see experts in a different sport, with tangential tiny (< 1 sentence) mention that he'd discussed his new sport with them too. [ the Lau Philip """"LA"""" interview].
 3 entries marked """"Reference and support of , Written Reference"""" [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence).
 A short writeup of a """"local information"""" kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper.

In brief of the 11:
 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less """"sourced"""" material on it or """"substantial"""" coverage (they had precisely zero coverage); 
 3 were claims of personal """"I think  is a great guy"""" letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent; 
 1 was self-written
 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much """"I discussed the topic with them"""" in a college magazine interview)
 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even """"news for a day""""  or evidence of anything beyond """"a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall"""".

Your assessment of these, at AFD, was:
 It is reliably sourced
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts. Probably via self-promotional input. 
 There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest.
|}
 That the cited pages are evidence of notability
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 They don't mention it, or even date from a time the topic existed, nor are online versions provided! How on earth could they """"reliably evidence"""" it?
|}
 That the """"11 sources"""" are """"independent""""
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 3 are claims that """"please support me"""" letters exist; they are even stated to be """"personal references""""; unpublished and uncited
 1 is his own clearly self-written web page on a local village web host
|}
 That the cites show it is """"non-localized""""
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 The page doesn't list a link so you can't have checked the cite, yet you say the citation """"proves"""" it.

Let me just say that my friend is a very dedicated fan, which the news clip even attests to, and although his comments might seem a bit unusual, I think they're interesting in that they speak unique ways a fan could view a movie.

As far as copyright infringement or irrelevance, I've already addressed how the clip is relevant, so I'll say what I have to on IP. Having worked in an intellectual property firm for a few years, and now as a student in law school, I am convinced from what I know of the law that this clip does not infringe upon any rights of the film, and any infringement that has occurred thus far from it has been attended to by the ABC news team for the release of their story. So, please, can we try to negotiate or come to some sort of agreement that it will be okay to leave this clip up?

Although I understand your arguments, I am surprised you don't understand mine.  I don't find it labyrinthine, or at least not particularly so.  (Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this.
 

[The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re. Abbey Road being the final album or not:Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles. Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. 
...
After the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album """"just like the old days. .. just like we used to,"""" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be """"the way they used to be."""" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and """"go out on a high note.""""re. the position of """"The End"""":""""The End"""" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by """"Her Majesty"""". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, """"Her Majesty"""" followed """"Mean Mr. Mustard""""...

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",1.0

"As far as presenting sources are concerned, the book The life and exploits of Alexander the Great  sites much more sources in detail than source, which I think refers to some sources already referred by others. As such it is as credible as its own sources and not whether the Author is researcher of repute and printed by reputed publisher. Its credibility therefore lies in sources which are presented sparsely in the book perhaps, perhaps not. As far as the Author is concerned, in my understanding, he himself suggested that the story of Alexander that originated from Egypt should be considered more authentic than others ( reasons given as ..it is hardly likely that their writers and scribes would hasten to record his history, whereby they would also incidentally describe their own national defeat; to these countries, then, we must not look for the original Alexander story. Similarly, we must not look to the states of Greece for it, because at the death of Alexander the memory of their subjugation and the victorious deeds which he wrought for the glory of Macedon would be too fresh in the minds of their peoples. One country only could be the birthplace of the Alexander story, and that country was Egypt..). I am not sure if the general discussion is driven by this very idea i.e. keeping the Alexander story from Egypt as authentic (which the scholarship of the author has indeed explained so well along with origin of other sources, especially ones from Greece that perhaps dominate current understanding). This according to me, forms one of the essence of the Alexander story, and I hope someone clarifies which story is the Egypt story in the said book which I myself is unsure for I don't have that experience and skill to tell out the exact parts off Egypt origins. At the most I can only hope that someone will research into the Alexander story from Egypt, and not his fanboy fantasies from Greece, to put forth a credible understanding if not already done. Then perhaps someone can put up that as reliable secondary source on the internet and can be referred to here.",1.0

""" November 2007 (UTC)

It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:

According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:

- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.

- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!

The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.

Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this """"Discussion""""  introduces my """"discovery"""" (a child would do it). It says:

- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise.""""

But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.

Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!

The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.

Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

 About Einstein 

My search of any document that might bear Einstein's name - in the League of Nations archive - in between 1930 - 1932 returns no results. See http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/archivplan.aspx.  By reviewing five books dealing with Einstein's work and life - not a single one mentioned this Einstein's support to the Ustase cause. Just one, written in German,

Einstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352

Indem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. """"Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"""", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. """"Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir 
nach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."""" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.

Reading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was 'The """"inside story"""" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.'

So, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda. About the same propaganda, see:

Appeal of the Croatian Academicians to the World of Civilisation: How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University, Dr. Milan Sufflay was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship
by Croatian University clubs association, Zagreb, 1931 32 pages

which was elaborated by 

""""Blood and Homeland"""": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940
by Marius Turda, Paul Weindling, Central European University Press, 2007 page 107

Shortly afterwards, students from the Croatian University Club Association produced an English language pamphlet, How the Croatian Savant, Professor of University Dr. Milan Šufflay, was Murdered by the Serbian Royal Dictatorship, in which they appealed to European public opinion to recognize that the murder of Šufflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist South Slav state. In such a state, the """"European culture"""" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which """"orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"""" had been subsumed into a system """"not only contrary but also odious to European culture""""

Turda also says that """"His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"""" (no source was given)

About the Sufflay murderer

Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254

Goldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that Šufflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, 'was killed on the street in Zagreb. The killers were never found"""" see also: Croatia: A History
by Ivo Goldstein, translated by Nikolina Jovanovic,  McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1999 - page 125

About the same Sufflay

Women, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45: 1919-1945 By Kevin Passmore, Manchester University Press, 2003 page 115, Fascism in Croatia chapter: Ante Starcevic and Milan Šufflay, who used a demonic concept of Serbs as the cornerstone of their ideologies.

Conflicts: Studies in Contemporary History by Lewis Bernstein Namier, Macmillan, 1942 page 49

The racial theories of a Croat writer named Šufflay were taken up since Sufflay had held that the Croats were not Slavs like the Serbs, bu were descendants of a settlement of Goths.

War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich
Published by Stanford University Press, 2001 page 20:

if the instruction manual was written by GDI, then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of Nod were.  Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to conflict, especially if it could be established that the manual was a GDI document, and therefore biased and uninformed.

It was fabricated simply to damage my credibility.  He says this despite the fact that I had not used any unreliable sources on the page. His poorly thought out and executed statement affects his own credibility rather than mine. When asked for clarification of his accusation, he produces four links. Of the four, two were posted after his offensive comment was made. Therefore, I assume he was taking about the first two links that I had already provided when he said it.  The first two links (both of them) were from of newspaper articles from the Washington Post . Yes both of them!  This person has says that particular source is not reliable and that he can produce MORE reliable sources! that damages HIS credibility -not mine.  I'm calling bullshit on everything he said.  For the reasons above I am calling User:BullRangifer a liar.

 chimes in with his two cents supporting the same contention as the the last discredited guy.  He got his lame comment in before I posted the second two links. Those links were for the Associated Press and Government of Canada (but lots of other reliable places have this stuff).  He didn't back up his statement by responding with the source that he was referring to and lost credibility too. For this reason,  is also a Liar.  That's not all. This person must be the brains of this operation. Right here on this page  puts forth the argument that """"And none of this shows that there is no chemtrails conspiracy theory.""""

= My Famous Article ==witze  happiness − wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",1.0

"""************************ HENRIETTA VAN LAER says, No,. it's not that having an agenda at all is a problem for Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.
POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police.
 I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.
Under """"conservative"""" we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term """"fat cat"""" means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid.

 this is the English-language article about Ngo; and the great majority of English text written about Ngo (and other Vietnamese generally) do not include diacritics.  In English, in fact, inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect (at best) or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard English orthography.  (Please note I am by no means an English-language bigot: I am a student of the Vietnamese language, and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in Vietnamese.  However, it is clear that in English, the diacritics play no role in pronunciation.)

""""NDP-affiliated""""
I added a fact tag to the four-times-reinserted modifier """"NDP-affiliated"""" to the mention of Bill Tieleman; other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty, nor are publishers such as CanWest (which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the BC Liberal Party, also one of the party's major financial contributors).  It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christy_Clark&action;=historysubmit&diff;=401129881&oldid;=401095803 this edit by ).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the """"informed media"""".  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her """"clean"""" of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only """"Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.""""

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast",1.0

I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers.

In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

If we consider this, in the Americas case it should be South America and not Latin America.
Second case, Mexico has a great GDP but in overal terms GDP is not the only factor, we should consider military, power projection and foreign policy. Mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the USA

Edits by Keraunos

Hi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them:

 You added the edit """"because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""""

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.

If people read further into the body of the article, under the section """"Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"""" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free).

 You added a bit into here: """"the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""""

I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as """"avatar""""). The term preceding your edits, """"simulated reality,"""" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.

 You added most of this: """"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""""

One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to """"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"""" with """"mind children"""" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.

I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:

F. J. Tipler, """"The structure of the world from pure numbers,"""" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as """"Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"""" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007.

 You added the section """"Criticism from string theory.""""

I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to """"Implications from string theory,"""" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.

This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction.

 You moved the """"See also"""" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.

Based upon Wikipedia's """"Featured articles,"""" it appears that the preferred location of the """"See also"""" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back.

""" September 2013 (UTC)

I love how I specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here, and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission.  Your 2-line response was the equivalent of """"nana-nana boo-boo,"""" as far as I am concerned. Let's dissect these 2 lines.

""""::you don't understand propaganda.""""
That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. 

""""You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.""""
I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, """"base tan""""), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). 

So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not """"a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?"""". That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as """"presenting one side of an argument"""" to """"influence the attitude of the community""""? Or, is it that, as you say, I just """"don't understand propaganda""""? 

I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my """"opinion"""". 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of """"good business"""" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o",1.0

 Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. 

COPYVIO
This article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   

Alot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism. 
  
 Tyco 
Almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. 

I think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  

I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the """"Early years"""" section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  

It still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a 
secondary source (i.e. democracy now).

I modified the quote and attributed properly.

 

The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  

No problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway.

 The """"forced abortions"""" part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the """"Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway"""" chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.  

 The Indian tribes scandal 
 
This area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.

Basically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. 

I moved the whole scandal to its own page. This makes much more sense since although Abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players, in particular Ralph Reed. I am not doing this to hide the scandal, I think that people looking for info on i",1.0

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

 Regarding Loyalmoonie and LGBT categories 

Looked into it, and this editor seems to be pushing an anti-LGBT agenda. They've done similar stuff over at Sailor Moon, and made """"official-looking"""" warnings to other editors.

I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, """"In Cold Blood"""", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.

 Pseudonymous editing 

copied from an email received offline
Hi,

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  

Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.

 It is true that I have come into the fray to defend Ivy Goh Nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me.

Both user:ivygohnair and user:chandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed: ie Singapore literature and writing; secondly, it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names; If this had been the case, the problem wouldn't have arisen.

 Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,1.0
"The marvels and mysteries of cite web 

Hei, 
Sorry I didn’t respond earlier. Was through all the material on using  and the time got away. Only had time to run a quick experiment with ‘’cite webb’’ before going out to meet Herr Professor Omberg for breakfast, and then on to do what must be done for the day. But, now that there is time to write, this is what I understand: 

 Using the cite web template assures one adds a fair bit of relevant information so that the reference is more consistent 

 And apparently someone amongst our wikipedia friends “rides a robot” to identify new “cite web” templates and makes sure that they go into WebCite to request a permanent archive. 

Somehow – should the link rot, as it undoubtedly will sooner of later – someone will know how to retrieve the reference from WebCite and repoint the reference so it is still live 

If this is a correct understanding, then using  is a virtuous thing to do and I will do it. For this insight, thank you!

RSA Labss (Now EMC), MIT, and ACM are wrong? 
VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, """"someone you know"""" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can """"talk"""" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?

Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.  That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!  Take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful.  I just didn't realize you alone set these standards.  I repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly.

There are actually four Lord Fairfaxes mentioned in this article. You have Martin's grandfather (5th Lord Fairfax), his uncle (6th Lord Fairfax), his other uncle (7th Lord Fairfax), and cousin (8th Lord Fairfax). Since the majority of this article deals with his uncle, the 6th Lord Fairfax, I've tried to disambiguate as best I can. In the prose, I've stated: """"Martin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719."""" The 6th Lord Fairfax was known as """"Lord Fairfax,"""" so I've tried to start this out in the prose so that the reader will know it refers to the 6th Lord Fairfax. In the lede, I've rendered the sentence as: """"Raised in humble surroundings in England, Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax), in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary, which encompassed up to .""""

 Deletion of Dave Warwak page 

Wondering why is was necessary to delete the page on Dave Warwak, an educator of vegan practices and animal rights. I see that your comment on the reason for deletion was """"the only thing he is known for is being fired"""" however that is not the case in the animal friendly, vegetarian, vegan community. In fact he is praised by many for his passion in properly educating children about the origins of their food. Why would you find it so crucial to """"speedy"""" delete a page that simply speaks of CRUELTY FREE living, and aims to educate people on the truth about their """"food""""? Is that information threatening to Wikipedia for some reason? And I wouldn't think as a wiki admin that your OPINION on the topic is reason enough to control what info is available and what is deleted. YOU may know Mr. Warwak as only being fired, but being the intelligent science studying individual that you are, surly you must realize that his efforts to educate children and promote compassion for animals is actually very honorable and deserving of recognition. PLEASE show a little compassion yourself and undelete the page.""",1.0

 Pandur 

The name derives from pandur, a Sumerian term for long-necked lutes. Source of our knowledge about this instrument is since the ancient Greek Mantineia marble (4th century BC), now exhibited at National Archaeological Museum of Athens, depicting the mythical contest between Apollo and Marsyas, where Greek Pandouris is being played by a muse seated on a rock.National Archaeological Museum of Athens, e-book by Latsis Foundation, p.346 Lutes have been present in ancient Greece.Pandura, the first appearance in Greece.
